The aim of pre-processing is an improvement of the image data that suppresses unwilling distortions or enhances some image features important for further processing, although geometric transformations of images (e.g. rotation, scaling, translation) are classified among pre-processing methods here since similar techniques are used.",

    abstract = {We propose a novel method for the automatic segmentation of brain MRI images by using discriminative dictionary learning and sparse coding techniques. In the proposed method, dictionaries and classifiers are learned simultaneously from a set of brain atlases, which can then be used for the reconstruction and segmentation of an unseen target image. The proposed segmentation strategy is based on image reconstruction, which is in contrast to most existing
        atlas-based labeling approaches that rely on comparing image similarities between atlases and target images. In addition, we propose a Fixed Discriminative Dictionary Learning for Segmentation (F-DDLS) strategy, which can learn dictionaries offline and perform segmentations online, enabling a significant speed-up in the segmentation stage. The proposed method has been evaluated for the hippocampus segmentation of 80 healthy ICBM subjects and 202 ADNI images. The
            robustness of the proposed method, especially of our F-DDLS strategy, was validated by training and testing on different subject groups in the ADNI database. The influence of different parameters was studied and the performance of the proposed method was also compared with that of the nonlocal patch-based approach. The proposed method achieved a median Dice coefficient of 0.879 on 202 ADNI images and 0.890 on 80 ICBM subjects, which is competitive compared with
            state-of-the-art methods.}

    abstract = {Quantitative magnetic resonance analysis often requires accurate, robust, and reliable automatic extraction of anatomical structures. Recently, template-warping methods incorporating a label fusion strategy have demonstrated high accuracy in segmenting cerebral structures. In this study, we propose a novel patch-based method using expert manual segmentations as priors to achieve this task. Inspired by recent work in image denoising, the proposed nonlocal patch-based
        label fusion produces accurate and robust segmentation. Validation with two different datasets is presented. In our experiments, the hippocampi of 80 healthy subjects and the lateral ventricles of 80 patients with Alzheimer's disease were segmented. The influence on segmentation accuracy of different parameters such as patch size and number of training subjects was also studied. A comparison with an appearance-based method and a template-based method was also carried out.
            The highest median kappa index values obtained with the proposed method were 0.884 for hippocampus segmentation and 0.959 for lateral ventricle segmentation.}
