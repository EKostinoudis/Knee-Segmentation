	abstract="Pre-processing is a common name for operations with images at the lowest level of abstraction --- both input and output are intensity images. These iconic images are of the same kind as the original data captured by the sensor, with an intensity image usually represented by a matrix of image function values (brightnesses). The aim of pre-processing is an improvement of the image data that suppresses unwilling distortions or enhances some image features important for further processing, although geometric transformations of images (e.g. rotation, scaling, translation) are classified among pre-processing methods here since similar techniques are used.",
